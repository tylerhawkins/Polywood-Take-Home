# Polywood-Take-Home
Take home coding challenge for Polywood

Prerequisites:
- Node.js
- npm

To make this page fully functional, you will need to download and install Node.js and node packet manager with brew, or another utility, if you don't have it installed already. See <a href="https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x">here</a> for Mac.

After you have those installed, pull down this git repository. Inside of the repository, you need to run "npm install" to install dependencies needed for this project.

After dependencies are installed, you should see a "node_modules" directory in your project root.

Congratulations, the project is now able to run fully functional!
